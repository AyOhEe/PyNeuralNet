#End goal for the viewer
#   -can remote connect to any instance of a simulation and observe the active networks
#       -can run network at normal speed or step through one at a time, or at a certain speed
#   -can open a genome and display the structure
#       -can edit and save opened genomes
#Would also like, for any simulation i make, for it to be made in two parts:
#   -the server (handles simulating the environment)
#   -the client (handles observing and controlling the environment/server itself,
#       hyperparameters, speed, etc...)
